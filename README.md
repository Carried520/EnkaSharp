## üì¶ Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
This project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer), which uses a version format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **Patch** ‚Äî Increases when bug fixes, new features, new methods or small improvements are made that do not affect compatibility.
- **Minor** ‚Äî Increases when new features or functionality are added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Major** ‚Äî Increases when there are incompatible changes that break backward compatibility.

## Creating Client
```csharp
var memoryCache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions());
IEnkaClient client = EnkaProviderFactory.Create(new EnkaClientConfig { UserAgent = "Carried-Api-Test"} , memoryCache);
// we have to call InitializeAsync() to populate assets before we can use EnkaClient
await client.InitializeAsync();
```

For Asp.Net and other Dependency Injection Scenarios:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();
builder.Services.AddEnkaClient(new EnkaClientConfig { UserAgent = "Carried-Api-Test"});
```
For ASP.NET best bet would be to create BackgroundService to initialize our assets:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddHostedService<StartupService>();
```

```csharp
public class StartupService : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly IEnkaClient _client;

    public StartupService(IEnkaClient client)
    {
        _client = client;
    }

    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        await _client.InitializeAsync();
    }
}
```

## Using Client
```csharp
// provide uid - your hoyoverse uid
EnkaGenshinData genshinData = await _enkaClient.Genshin.GetGenshinDataAsync(uid);
// access properties freely
```

### üè∑Ô∏è Branches
- **Main** ‚Äî This is the `main` branch. This contains the latest stable release and is the exact source running in production.
- **Dev** ‚Äî This is the `development` branch. This contains the latest staging release that is marked for deployment and is the exact source running on staging.
- **Feature** ‚Äî This is a `feature/*` branch. This contains a new feature that will be added. Any feature should have its own branch. Once completed the branch should be merged into the `development` branch, afterward the feature branch should be deleted.
- **Bugfix** ‚Äî This is a `bugfix/*` branch. This contains a bugfix that will be added. Any bugfix should have its own branch. Once completed the branch should be merged into the `development` branch, afterward the bugfix branch should be deleted.
